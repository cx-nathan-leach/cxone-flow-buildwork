\section{2.1.3}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Bug fix for group assignment configuration naming.
    \item Bug fix to gracefully handle ADO API branch policy responses not containing \texttt{refName} elements.
\end{itemize}

\section{2.1.2}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Azure DevOps: Any branch that has a policy assigned is now considered
    a protected branch in addition to the repository's default branch.
    \item Project names can now be dynamically generated by using a project naming script.
    \item Legacy default project names can optionally be converted to a new dynamic name
    upon receipt of the next webhook event.
    \item Projects can now be automatically assigned to groups upon project create.
    \item Existing projects can optionally be updated to the appropriate assigned groups upon handling
    the next webhook event.
    \item Documentation updates have been made to clarify some of the the YAML configuration elements.
    \item A bug was fixed that would cause repositories that have broken symbolic links to abort the scan orchestration.
    \item The git cloning will now recursively resolve submodules.
    \item A container healthcheck has been added.
    \item Performance improvements when zipping files to upload for scanning.
    \item The CxOneFlow process now runs as a low-privilege user.
\end{itemize}

\section{2.1.1}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Added a kickoff API for use with \extlink{https://github.com/checkmarx-ts/cxone-flow-audit}{cxone-flow-audit}
          to iterate SCM repositories and perform an initial scan.
    \item Added severity icons for pull request details.
    \item Fixed a bug where unexpected severity values caused PR decoration failures.
\end{itemize}


\section{2.1.0}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fixed a branch naming bug that affected names of scanned branches that had "/" separated segments.
    \item Added Gitlab SCM support.
    \item Improved logging for feedback workflows.
    \item Fixed an issue with the resolver agent failing when no resolver options are provided.
    \item A breaking configuration change was implemented such that \texttt{repo-match} values that are a wildcard
          match for any value are no longer allowed.  This is to prevent potential SSRF attacks exposing SCM credentials
          if the SCM shared secret is compromised.  The route match should, at minimum, specify common parts of the FQDN
          portion of the Git clone URL. Please consult the documentation for more information.
\end{itemize}


\section{2.0.0}

This version is compatible with any configuration YAML that works with version 1.3.  If you are using an external message queue (e.g. not the
message queue running internally in the CxOneFlow container), please see the documentation regarding "Upgrading CxOneFlow from 1.x to 2.x".

\begin{itemize}
    \item Refactored to use the shared library \extlink{https://github.com/checkmarx-ts/cxone-async-api}{\textbf{cxone-async-api}}\space instead
    of an embedded copy of the \texttt{cxone\_api} code.
    \item Added support for dependency resolution execution using SCA Resolver prior to executing a scan.
    \item The \texttt{cxoneflow-resolver-agent} is available for Debian platforms.  This is the agent that executes SCA Resolver.
    \item The \texttt{cxoneflow-resolver-agent} supports SCA Resolver execution via containers using the \toolkit.
    \item The server YAML configuration documentation has been updated to add clarity about the YAML configuration format.
\end{itemize}


\section{1.3}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Now supports GitHub Enterprise and GitHub Cloud
    \item Documentation updates
\end{itemize}

\section{1.2}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fixed problem where pooled connections to the SCM would cause PR failures when the network routing 
    fabric discarded the connection route.
    \item BREAKING CHANGE - Added a new configuration option for the CxOneFlow server base URL used to host image
    artifacts used in PR feedback comments.
    \item Fixed an issue with \texttt{ssl-verify} not working with self-signed CAs.
    \item Documentation updates.
\end{itemize}


\section{1.1}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Added more verbose logging to aid in troubleshooting feedback workflows.
    \item Fixed an issue where the feedback scan polling parameters were ignored in some configurations.

    \item If detailed PR feedback comment content exceeds the SCM's comment limit, the comment will be limited to the summary content.
    \item Fixed an issue with the scan permalink published in the PR feedback comments.
\end{itemize}
